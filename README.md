# Senseye ML Engineer Code Challenge
As UNets and Image Segmentation are new for me, I spent some time getting familiar with them and reading through the various articles (very helpful!). With the time constraint, I used one of the articles as a starter code. I adjusted it the code to work with the given data.

 I opted to use an already created UNet model(model.py) that was linked in the second article. If I have more time, I would have spent it tweaking the model, fix the script that splits the data into folders, and adding better documentation to my scripts.



  ### Include a very short summary of how you've organized the solution and how to run your code.

  To run the solution, you will need to update the file paths in the args parser of the script `run_unet_model.py` and then you should be able to `run run_unet_model.py` in the command line.
